# Conway's Game "Life" with modifications

1. The main difference of my project is - TRIANGLES
 
   instead of squares, I have triangles.

 2. Each triangle has 12 neighbours

  If a dead cell has 4 neighbors, life begins in it
  If an alive cell has more than 4 neighbors or less than 3, then it dies

3. First you have to configure some settings of the programm - number of rows, number of columns, and... SPEED OF THE PROGRAMM

 4. if you are interested in how I store triangles in the matrix, then put +95 points and I will tell you
